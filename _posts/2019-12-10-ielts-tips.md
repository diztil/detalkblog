This article is aimed to provide you with all the necessary details, instructions and advice for you to ace your IELTS exam!! Emphasis has been placed on the Academic module in this article.

* * * * *

Section 1 : Listening
---------------------

TIME PROVIDED : 30 mins + 10 mins

4 sections (increasing difficulty with every section)

![](https://doomielts.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/e7469-listeningicon.png)

Section A contains a conversation between 2 people.\
Section B usually contains only one person speaking , e.g. a tour guide.\
Section C usually contains a group discussion, e.g. a class or work discussion.\
Section D usually contains only person explaining something, e.g. giving a lecture.

1.  At the beginning of each section, read the questions for that section carefully, before the recording starts. This will help you to follow the recording and identify the answers.
2.  After completing a section, it is better to look ahead and read the questions for the next section than to worry about the last section.
3.  You will sometimes have a list of options to choose from. The possible answers may be listed in alphabetical order and not necessarily in the order you will hear them.
4.  Be careful about word limits. If there is an instruction : "Write no more than two words", writing more than two words will mean you will receive no marks at all for your answer, even if some of the words were correct.
5.  Try to listen for key words or synonyms (words that have the same or almost the same meaning as another word) from the question to help you find the answer. For example, in the recording, you may hear "*She likes going to the gym and playing tennis.*" On your answer sheet, this could appear as "*She is an active person.*"
6.  You may be asked to write down words that have been spelled out in the recording. In order to do this well, you need to know the English alphabet and how each letter is pronounced.
7.  Just to be safe, it's best to write down anything that is spelt in the recording.
8.  While you're listening to the recording, cross out the options that don't fit. This makes it easier for you to identify the right answer.
9.  If you are writing dates as an answer to any question, it is okay to write them in any order. For example, "22nd April", "April 22", and "22 April" are all correct.
10. If there are questions which you cannot answer, leave them there. Move onto the next question. This will help you to stay calm and positive.
11. Go back to those questions at the end... if you have time.

Section 2 : Reading
-------------------

TIME PROVIDED : 1 hour

![](https://doomielts.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/ddb09-reading.png)

3 passages with random order of difficulty, e.g. Passage 1 could be most difficult than the others.

1.  No extra time for transferring answers. So write down answers to sheet. Use the question paper for rough work.
2.  Variety of comprehension question types.
3.  To improve your performance in the Reading test, you need to practise reading a variety of English texts. This will help you develop the ability to read quickly.
4.  Read every question carefully first before reading the passages. So you know exactly which pieces of information to find.
5.  Underline possible answers as you go.
6.  When you come to reading the passage, read it quickly ("skim read") in the first attempt, enough to get a 50% understanding about the text.
7.  Don't worry about words you don't understand.
8.  Then read each question again to remind yourself which parts of the passage you will need to read again in detail.
9.  There is no need to think that you need extra knowledge for any question.
10. The passages will contain all the information you need to answer the question. You won't have to use any general knowledge of a topic.
11. If you are asked to label a diagram, you will find the words you need in the text.
12. Be sure to copy the words carefully from the passage with the correct spelling.
13. If there are questions which you cannot answer, leave them there. Move onto the next question. This will help you to stay calm and positive.
14. Go back to those questions at the end... if you have time.

Section 3 : Writing
-------------------

TIME PROVIDED : 15 mins + 45 mins

![](https://doomielts.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/f5d16-icon2.png)

There are 2 tasks :

-   Task 1
    -   Diagram/Map summary
    -   OR
    -   Chart/Graph summary
-   Task 2
    -   Argumentative essay (e.g. "Agree or disagree....")
    -   OR
    -   Opinion-based essay (e.g. "Do you believe....")
    -   OR
    -   Discussion essay (e.g. "Discuss....")

A general guidance for a standard essay format :

-   1st paragraph : Introduction (2 lines)
-   2nd and 3rd paragraphs : main body (5-7 lines)
-   4th paragraph : conclusion (1 line)

1.  There are no right or wrong answers or opinions. The examiners are assessing how well you can use your English to report information and express ideas.
2.  The ONE question the examiners are asking themselves when checking your answer is :  *"Does this person know how to write an essay in English?"*
3.  Analyze questions carefully to make sure your answer contains all the points covered by the question.
4.  Be careful to use your own words by "paraphrasing", because the examiner will not include words copied from the question in the word count.
5.  You don't have to write very long sentences to do well. If your sentences are too long, they will become less coherent and also make it harder for you to control the grammar.
6.  In Task 1, you only have to select and compare relevant information from the data presented in a table, graph, chart.
7.  Once again, a kind reminder : do not copy words from the question. Use your own words.
8.  You shouldn't try to interpret (explain) or give reasons for any data!
9.  In Task 2, don't forget to plan your essay before starting. (The whole 250 words essay can be done in just 30 minutes, trust me!) Take 5-10 minutes for planning.
10. Support your answer with real-life examples (called "anecdotes").
11. Write the conclusion as a *paraphrasing* of the introduction. Or simply write it based on the most important information you provided in the *body paragraphs*.

Section 4 : Speaking
--------------------

TIME PROVIDED : 15-20 mins

![](https://doomielts.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/d9935-speakingicon.png)

#### Part 1 : Interview

-   All about yourself! Don't feel shy!

#### Part 2 : Cue Card Speech

-   Talk for 2 minutes (until examiner stops you).
-   Topic based on a card handed to you.

#### Part 3 : Discussion 

-   Longer duration of talking about personal opinions on the cue card topic you got.

1.  Practise speaking in English everywhere! With friends, at work, on the phone, etc.
2.  You can consider recording yourself with a phone or tape recorder. Play it to judge yourself.
3.  Be confident that you can allow yourself to be recorded in the actual exam day.
4.  There are no right or wrong answers or opinions. The examiners are assessing how well you can express your ideas and opinions in good English.
5.  It will help you if you imagine you are talking to a friend. Remember that you are not being assessed on your opinions... only on your use of English.
6.  Avoid repeating words that are used in the examiner's question. Use your own words to show the examiner your full ability!
7.  Speak clearly and at a natural pace (speed). If you speak too fast, you may make mistakes or pronounce words incorrectly.
8.  Be cautious (careful) about the tense (past/present/future) used in the questions.
9.  Practise pronunciation of numbers. For example, some numbers can sound very similar when spoken, e.g. "thirty" and "thirteen", "forty" and "fourteen", "fifty" and "fifteen", etc.
10. Don't simply say "Yes, I do" or "No, I don't". Answer in as much detail as you can.
11. Give examples from your own experience -- this will develop your answers.
12. Try to answer as fully as possible and give reasons for your answers. This will help you to use a wider range of vocabulary and grammar.
13. Lastly, DO NOT STOP OR PAUSE!!
14. If you need to pause, try to use some clever and stylish methods, e.g. "*Well, I haven't thought about it for a long time, but I think I would say....*"
15. The trick above will allow you to show the examiner that you are not pausing for searching words. Instead, try to show him/her that you are simply "thinking" about the topic.
