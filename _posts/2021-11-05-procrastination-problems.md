So recently I found myself **unable to cope up** with the pace of my university life. The instructors and professors keep on declaring assignments and quizzes and meanwhile I am **just relaxing**. You must be thinking that "Oh, maybe he's so good at studies that he goes carefree!"

Trust me, it isn't anything like that. The feeling of **guilt** plus the burning and stagnant sensation of **regret** is flooding my mind. Yet, I **cannot focus!** I just cannot sit down to study anymore. All my courses this semester are acquiring low marks... because of this overlooked habit. Well, to be fair, this **habit** didn't become so strong in a single day. Over time, as I kept on **procrastinating** and leaving my work undone "for later", the days kept on getting worse and worse.

And behold! Now you have a type of **mental disorder** where your attention span has been drugged on heavy doses of **staying inattentive** and doing other things. This is literally me right now. And even as I write this post, I have 2 quizzes due tonight, and another assignment due Monday (8th November). I'm so **doomed**, but still I am **not feeling** anything. Nothing. Not even the slightest bit of anxiety or fear I should have because I received **unbelievably low marks** for my midterm tests this semester.

This certainly reminds me of a quote from a movie character, first introduced by my best friend :

> "I said I'll get better tomorrow. But tomorrow never came."

A tragic **death** to anyone's intellect. I'd say for now, that you should perceive "procrastination" as being the equivalent of **cigarettes for your mind**. You don't usually spot their negative impacts on your health and well-being... until it's too late. 

They're seriously **dangerous habits**.

I, Dewan Mukto, personally warn you not to end up in a **sticky situation** like this. Oh well, I hope I can finish my quizzes by tonight. They're dreadfully difficult for me anyway, since I hadn't been paying attention during lectures either.

> P.S. Don't tell any of this to my parents!
