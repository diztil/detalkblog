## Prologue : Sand Destiny

After trudging helplessly, Vandermann's throat was as dry as a piece of sandpaper lying in the middle of the Sonoran desert for weeks. He was indeed in the Sonoran desert. He was an U.S. Marine, and Marines were all real tough guys. But what could he do, when all the tough guys are down, killed by some nasty Russian paramilitary? The Russians had captured the entire west coast of America, to get their dirty hands on the damn nukes beneath the Yucca Mountains. The U.S. president had sent for the American troops to go ahead and intercept. But what could they do, in the heat, the unbearable heat, of the desert that lay between the mission destination, and the army base? Obviously, the Marines had to use aircraft to get there, right? Well, they did. But on the way, Sgt. Vandermann Vugerton's helicopter had suffered an engine failure. So he and his partner, both escaped from the chopper, before it hit the sandy ground, and exploded. They found a tiny wooden hut, where a cowboy was lurking in the shadows. Vandy's assistant had a fight with the guy, but the guy had a damn Remington 870 shotgun. So there was a bang! bang! and both the cowboy and Vandy's assistant, dropped to the ground, covered in blood.

In his dying moments, the cowboy, named Joe Catshoe, handed Vandy some letters, crammed into an envelope.

"Take them," the cowboy had said, spitting a bit of blood out of his lip as he spoke. "And give them to my nephew, Cooper Blackburn. But when you...when you'll hand these...these letters...tell him..."

"Tell him what?" Vandermann took the envelope from Joe's severed hand. "Tell him what, sir?"

"Tell him...that...ahh..." the cowboy's body gave a quick jolt, and his words barely escaped from his mouth. The last bit of info was really crucial, but Vandermann missed it. Too bad.

So there he was, walking along the cursed sand, with no hope left in mind. But hope reappeared, in the form of a vehicle.

His right hand clutched the envelope tightly, to protect it from the harsh, dusty desert winds blowing from the southeastern direction. His eyes stung from being assaulted by sand grains. His M4A1 carbine rifle was hanging from his back, swinging this way and that.

In the horizon, he could spot a few clumps of cacti, and dead bushes and scrubs. Nothing interesting, just regular desert crap. The sky was an ever blue blanket of infinite proportions, cloudless, and bright with hue. Usual weather. Nothing fun, nothing extraordinary. Just the lonely, sandy desert. Typical.

Slowly, a soft rumbling of an engine drifted towards his ears. It was a 4x4 jeep, by the looks of it, mounted by soldiers and cowboys. Great, so now more shitty cowboys were coming to take revenge for what Vandy's comrade had done to that old wretch. Hostile or not, he wasn't so sure. The sun was burning the back of his head. This had to be it. He deserved medical help, ASAP. And chance was peeking at his opportunity.

"Hey! Stop! Stop-halt!" Vandermann raised and waved his arms, to try to grab their attention. And sure enough, he did. The jeep decelerated calmly. But sand slipped through the tire treads easily.

"Yeah, how may we help you?" a cowboy with black aviators and big jaws spoke on behalf of the driver, sitting beside him. "Speak!"

"Um...I'm a Marine, so learn to respect men of high order. But that's not the reason I stopped you. I need help, sirs. Get me to a city or human settlement. I lost my air transport vehicle. So please let me in your gang."

"Okay, we'll see about that!" The tough-looking cowboy sunk into deep thought, for a while. He was wearing black in everything, except for the yellow outer jacket. A black cowboy hat sheltered his shoulder-length hair, dark as black. "Are you part of, or in association with, or allied with the Russian forces?"

"No, sir."

"Then what the hell are you doing, standing there, homie! Get in. Our gang is free and friendly to those who oppose against the damn Russians. We are a type of rebellion force, run by agencies back at New York. Ever heard of the Mission Integrated Workforce (MIW) or the Integrated Mission Force (IMF), buddy? Those are our sponsors! And this---" he widened his arms, indicating that he meant the jeep. "---is our mode of transport. Like or not, we'd have chosen you to join us, even if you hadn't tried to stop us. And do you need anything else, homie?"

"I need to see Cooper Black..." he showed him the envelope."To give him this."

"Oh, in that case..." the cowboy loaded a Colt.45 pistol."You are certainly welcome to come with us."

Vandermann gulped, as he slid into the space available at the back of the jeep, between the two soldiers.

"So when do I get to him?" he asked after a couple of minutes.

The cowboy beside the driver grinned.

"My dear friend, you already did!" he shot a round into the heart of the sky. Vandermann understood.
