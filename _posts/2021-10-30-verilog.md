## Overview
Over here, you will get to know about this hellish "computer architecture" language known as **Verilog** (iVerilog or Icarus Verilog in particular). This terrible (not really) language has an easy syntax than most **programming languages**. But that doesn't spare it from being difficult to understand at first glance. In a way, you could say learning Verilog has a rather steep curve.

Think of Verilog as a way of **representing hardware** virtually. Digital circuit simulations and whatnot.

## Installation
So first things first, we need to have Icarus Verilog installed on our computer systems, yes? If you are on **Ubuntu** (which is the OS I would recommend everyone), use this easy tactic :

~~~
sudo apt install iverilog
~~~

Next up, we'll need **gTKwave** as a dependency (required program/module to run it properly). Install that, too, with a swift copy-pasting of:

~~~
sudo apt install gtkwave
~~~

And now, we can commence on using iVerilog for undisclosed purposes. *:rubs_hands:*
