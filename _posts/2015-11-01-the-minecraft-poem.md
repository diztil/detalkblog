Down, down, to dungeons deep,\
Caves old and mountains high,\
Steve woke up as the sun rose up, from his sleep.\
But yet Steve gave out a pitiful sigh,\
When he saw a zombie attacking a villager,\
He took a sword and killed it, I'll wager!\
And so, the villager saw it whole, and thanked him,\
<!–-break-–>
"Thank you very much, young warrior, you have stopped me to scream,\
Let me tell you an old story, about a magical stream."\
And so, Steve nodded and sat there listening\
With wide eyes, so wide... so wide...\
That they started blinking sleepily, but they kept on glistening.\
He listened for too long a time; the sun sank down\
And the moon rose up, reflecting a dull, grayish --- brown.\
The story never seemed to be stopping,\
And so, the villager, with such joy, started hopping,\
For he was a thief, and Steve was asleep;\
He planned to throw Steve's body off a cliff.\
Out of nowhere, a light was shone,\
It was daylight, clear as flesh and bone.\
Steve gave a yawn and saw his fate:\
He'd have been killed if he awoke a little late.\
He caught the villager with his sword, the 'iron hand',\
And spilt his blood in Steve's own land.

The next day, Steve woke with a start,\
He scanned his area like a hunter throwing a dart,\
And collected some wood, some stone, and water as well...\
Those were the things he'd need, to go to Hell.\
In the world of Minecraft, Hell is known as the Nether,\
In it, nothing can survive, not even a light, angel's feather.\
Steve placed some lava, and mixed it with water,\
And whenever he does that, he feels as if making butter.\
They both hardened, and turned into obsidian,\
Which is a rock containing ash, dust, and the color cyan.\
(Don't worry, the 'cyan' was only a joke or mistake)\
Steve collected this rock and covered an entire lake.\
A nearby Nether Portal somehow became activated,\
And all sorts of old, rubbish, and out-dated\
Stuff began to pop up in Steve's adventurous mind.\
But why was he going to the Nether?\
Probably to stop his arch enemy: (Herobrine) the Stepfather!\
Suddenly, in the process of making the portal shine,\
Out of the sky dropped a mob; it was... Herobrine!!!

Herobrine was a long-known virtual freak,\
Who looks and acts like Steve, but uses 'Voice Tweak'.\
His brilliantly smooth and white eyes can pierce through stone,\
Including metal, trees, soil, water, lava, and flesh and bone.\
This unusual monster gave Steve a look of wanted revenge,\
For Steve had betrayed him; and also wanted to avenge\
The sudden death of Minecraft Maker, Notch;\
I'm not sure whether he liked butterscotch.\
"What do you want at this time of day?"\
Said Steve with a look of a deadly stray.\
Herobrine didn't answer, but only gave Steve a hit,\
Which happened so suddenly, that his heart skipped a beat.\
Steve was thrown back with such force\
That he almost felt as if falling off a horse.\
Herobrine smiled at this and grinned,\
But Steve wasn't done yet; his iron hand was pinned.\
"Ha ha! My dear Herobrine friend, now you shall get it!"\
Steve's speech was given, his handy torch lit,\
His iron hand split the pixels away, where the metal bit\
Into Herobrine's flesh, which created a lot of lint,\
And Herobrine said, "Till next time, when we shall meet!"\
With that, he burst into a mixture of light and heat.\
Steve was left lonely, angry, and quite desolate,\
But what you shall read next, shall change his fate!

The Nether Portal was already destroying itself,\
When Steve found the Portal sucking up the turf,\
And the ground was splitting apart when the sun\
Sank below the oceanic depths, at the end of its turn.\
The moon, with her silver blaze, dazzled across the earth,\
But Steve's mind was sizzling with anger, full of dirt.\
There was only one tool that Steve required: Eye of Ender,\
Which had unbelievable powers that could heal the curse\
That the world had received when it had gone asunder,\
In those days, the world was young, and thus, shone the stars.\
The Eye of Ender could only be found in the Nether,\
To claim it, Steve would've to kill the boss:\
The Wither.\
And then, picking up a nearby block of wood,\
Steve thrust it into the Portal, and it calmly stood\
Only for a moment; the wood was eaten whole by the aura\
Of complete destruction: it kills both fauna and flora.\
Steve reluctantly made his choice and jumped into despair,\
He made for the Portal, without any worries or any care,\
The Unholy aura devoured his soul, and almost destroyed him,\
But the pixels were hard enough to whip cream;\
And finally Steve found a way to fulfill his dream.

The first thing that you'll notice is the magma-covered walls,\
That'll make you shudder, probably even freeze your balls,\
And on the ground lay numerous corpses and dead remains\
Of ancient beings that are nameless (use your brains!),\
The sky is pitch black, and the water tastes sour,\
That's right! It's the Nether, without time, or hour.\
Steve's vision wasn't enough to penetrate through the outline\
Of the distant volcanic hills that glow red as wine;\
The secondary objective would be to find Herobrine.\
Far away, a dragon the size of a bus paced towards him,\
But unfortunately, all that Steve could do now, was scream,\
And this made the dragon, with full rage, eyeing the beam,\
The dragon's eyesight was way too scary even for a warrior,\
His breath of fire could even scare away a football team,\
And his only weakness was to attack from the rear.\
The dragon flew from north to south\
And a ball of fire was ready in its mouth.\
Steve was stunned to draw out his iron hand, his sword,\
So he took out a rope and tightened it at the cord,\
And aimed for one of the dragon's horns (or horn),\
But he missed, and the dragon yanked him off his feet,\
In the process, Steve's shoes came off, his blue T-shirt was torn,\
Soon enough, he was dangling upside-down, although airborne,\
The dragon was delighted to catch itself some pixelized meat.

Steve found himself lying only a few feet from the lava,\
When suddenly, another mob joined the fun,\
This new mob was programmed by C++, or perhaps Java,\
But its face had been rotated in a 180 degree turn.\
There wasn't any sign of the dragon yet, but in the Nether,\
Even the slightest exposure to your skin can burn it like leather.\
The mob let out a deafening screech\
That made Steve forget his days at the beach.\
Steve's eyes were too tired to sense the mob's colors,\
But the Mob had three heads instead of one,\
Then it struck to him, that this mob was the 'Wither',\
who was the boss of the Nether; his land had to be won\
In order to find the Eye of Ender, found somewhere here;\
And so, Steve decided to defeat the Wither with a spear.\
At first, the combat was too easy, it seemed.\
But the glowing eyes of the Wither, like gold they gleamed.\
While the Wither was busy, Steve made a dent in its armor,\
Out of which, as far as I know, loads of magma streamed.\
Steve was winning, yes he was! But near the end of the battle,\
The Wither's invisible, strong arms shook Steve like a rattle,\
But Steve didn't give up so easily; he knew the Wither's weak spot,\
And he threw his spear, which created a black, slit-like dot\
In the Wither's body, out of which, a blue liquid was spilling out;\
In short, Steve had won the battle, and the Nether, without a doubt.

Steve constructed another Nether Portal,\
And returned to the Overworld, the land of the mortal.\
The world before him, was nothing like before,\
It wasn't a single bit like it was, in the days of ancient lore,\
But now the earth had been taken whole, down to its fiery core\
By a game called Minecraft, which is the greatest RPG available,\
In which you can do anything you want, just keep it stable.\
Steve, the main role in Minecraft, thus continued on his quest\
To save the world; finally, you can say that this poem has reached\
Its full potential power, and I hope this is one of the best.
