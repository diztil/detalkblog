## Why use MuxSites?
MuxSites is a brand new cheap and efficient way of ordering and getting your own website designed, built and set up for you. At the moment, the service is manual, and you have to fill in the details yourself.

## Is MuxSites really free?
Yep! Definitely. They provide many more features and freedom of choice on their **Free Plan** than most website builders today. Once you order your site, you can have custom CSS, embeds, layouts (if it's not too complicated) added to your site.

## Consider PAYING a bit MORE
You can reap some interesting benefits by upgrading/choosing a premium plan for your site. For example, *this* website (detalk.muxsites.com) would qualify for a Personal plan.

Here are some comparisons with other platforms and sites which can be substituted by MuxSites :

You can stay at $0 forever if you only intend to have a single-page landing site for a link-in-bio. E.g. [***Carrd***](https://carrd.co/), [***Solo.to***](https://solo.to/).

If you go for the $5 package, you can have a beautiful blog site of your own rules. E.g. [***Medium***](https://medium.com/), [***Blogger***](https://blogger.com), [***Ghost***](https://ghost.org).

With the $20 plan per month, you have the ability to set up an online store like [***Ecwid***](https://www.ecwid.com/), [***Shopify***](https://www.shopify.ca/).

And finally, if you can spend $100 a month for your website, MuxSites will gladly provide enough facilities and promises to build up any app/site of your choice. Mainly great for building sites like [***Amrella***](https://amrella.muxworks.com), [***Darksalt***](https://darksalt.bubbleapps.io), [***Muxcord***](https://muxcord.apps.muxworks.com), etc.
