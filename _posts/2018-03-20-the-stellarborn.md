Intro
=====

Colors and spectra flashing and splashing everywhere across the heavens --- a battle between nebulae and a miraculous dream. Donned beneath a dawn of justice, packed with an influence that foreshadowed fear in the hearts of evil malice and heralded an eternal aura of prosperity for the worthy. Worlds apast, chasms apart, a shard of brilliant glory landed on Earth. <!–-break-–> It shone with a streak amidst the heart of cold, timeless, black frozen sky, that stroked through the mist of human supervision. No one saw it coming, no one witnessed its descent; only the surrounding stream of shimmering spirits sensed its presence.

The spirits knew its making. The spirits foretold its entrance. Was it truly lucky for the humans to avert their attention away from this supernatural source? Was it ethical to simply abide their sanity and step forth to corruption, sin, and chaos?

Humans --- they'd constructed their own foundations and civilizations yesterday; they're busy disrupting it and misusing intelligence today; they're planning for more projects and obstructions to attract their own signature of doom.

The scales had been shifted. Nature's blessings were interrupted by nature's disgust. Pollution, destruction, and world dominion : humans' blessings towards mother Earth. Was this their right? Was this a cone of silence to just bask in the shadow and watch humans play with fire in their hearts? How could the unseen spirits restore order to the homely planet?

The fragment of a burning star shed by a cold nebula from the nearest galaxy and a mixture of earthly elements was the key. And the aged, mature, and soul-empowered spirits were the ingredients.

Together combined and bound by linked souls, the stellar being was finally born. In the shape of an ordinary man, grasped by glints of clarified decisions and linked by the elements, he stepped out into the darkness --- a background of nocturnal peace. As lithe as a diamond-tipped whip, he walked with ordinary footsteps.

Somewhere out there, he knew he was being watched by vigilant eyes. He didn't care to look. But he knew he'd been discovered.

Right as the moon cast away with the dawn breaking sun's arrival, he began to run. He ran and ran, faster than any normal being. He felt his limbs growing stronger and tougher. He felt his childish body maturing into an adult. He triumphed to escape from the seer's farseeing sight's range...and failed.

Being stellarborn would never be the same again.

Chapter 1
=========

Jolting from the dreamy dimension of mental freedom and acres of free will, his mind collapsed back to reality --- a transition of a rainbow to grayscale. He'd been having these strange dreams again, he believed. Every night he thought over the fact, layer upon layer. Could it be true? Or were these simply mere visions of his multiverse imagination?

Fact or myth, they were dreams still --- his mind kept cloning these obscure states repeatedly; his mind was greatly ensnared by the dreams. He dreamt of every tinge, every movement, every voice, every emotion --- his dreams : they seemed so real.

Fresh sunlight seeped through closed shutters, spreading the spray of illumination in the form of chilled morning rays and calm, relaxing hues. Drops of solid shadow occupied every corner of the small bedroom, turning moods gloomy and mentalities lazy. The honeyed light painted his face in gold.

Back to the reason of his sudden awakening : his bedroom door wavered by the pounding of a fist, followed by a trickle of a female voice that sounded much like someone he knew very well.

"Wake up now, Altair! You'll be late for school. C'mon dear, up, up," his mother's voice dribbled across a sea of silence.

"Yee-yes, ma," his reluctant voice reflected back. He seemed much disturbed by the signs of her parental kindness.

Last night, he'd felt so liberated. Was it actually a dream or was his head providing him with more confused views about how the world works? Ever since he'd first seen the light of life, he'd been wondering about the same fact over and over again --- much like the old film reel --- that : why and for what purpose had he been born into this world of today. The precious curse of life.

Altair resolved out of bed --- his daily throne of transporting to other universes; 'his' playground of exploring different emotions and tasting the otherworldly feeling of subconsciousness.

He sluggishly disclosed the shutters that compensated for windows, allowing the fountain of golden heat to consume the place. Instantly, the shadows fled for cover; they faded away parallel to the rate at which last night's memories vanished from his volatile mind. Darkness declared a truce and let the light overcome its might.

His dreams : he couldn't remember them by identity, but he did, by heart. Why was his mind unstable for storing dreams? Ten seconds ago, he remembered each grain of detail. Ten seconds later, it all turned to oblivion.

Altair gazed out towards the clear patch of cyan sky outside and caught a glimpse of the last star's sparkle be drained out by the dominant sunlight.

*So it might be true. I am stellarborn*. He wondered what it meant. Did he have some kind of link with the nightly stars who blaze hotly against the cold sky? Did he possess supernatural ties to the spirit world? He had no clue. Altair hovered over the theory one last time before another flurry of knocks at the door intruded his thoughts.

"Hurry up and get dressed," his mother's words embraced his ears. Like clockwork, Altair followed the order acquiescently, leaving his mind still unaware of the involuntary actions he was about to perform. It was a daily ritual --- switching between clothes and outfits.

He gazed at his own reflection in a mirror adjacent to the singular closet that had occupied this room older than the hills. He saw only a teenage human standing there. How had he metamorphosed to this stage of life so soon? It only seemed like he was born yesterday. Time had flown past his life in a rush of studying, exams, hanging out, and freedom of choice. It didn't seem at all like his true life : the stress of surviving hordes of examinations wasn't making his life easier; it only poured more oil to troubled waters for the parents, for the teachers, but never for him, alone.

Friendship, peace, and hobbies gushed through his veins. Great rivers of kindness, justice, and punctuality crawled along his skin. Awesomeness, uniqueness, and happiness swarmed around his young brain. Silky strands of inspiration, wispy fragments of desire, and plush clouds of love hovered atop his frizzy hair. Minuscule particles of corruption dangled from the depths of his brave heart. Mortality surrounded his soul in a tight kiss of marked death.

He finished putting on his selected apparel before thrusting the mottled teak closet door shut, leaving the remnants of a feather-soft 'thud'.

Simultaneously, he looked back at the wild, freestyle teenager he'd become. He blinked those black onyx stones, that served as his eyes to look upon the world and its wonders. They shone with a luster of curiosity, concealing true secrets and faithful knowledge.

That smile like molten butter, that face like a postage stamp --- he knew who he was. He knew his identity, his existence in this world.

Named after a celestial trailblazer, he was Altair Jayden : the only (and lonely) child of the Jayden family. He knew his specialty --- nobody could distinguish between living matter and dead space any further deftly than him. Altair was a star; so was he bound to be one on Earth. His role model was the night sky, an universe of infinite proportions.

Retrieving his backpack from a study desk that had been transformed into a gaming console center, Altair unlocked his room door and stepped into the portal transcending to the living room.

Each footstep distorted the cool sleepy morning's aura. He noted the antique hardwood floors conjuring specks of rough dust and the creaks caused by every touch of his feet; the house was growing old.

His mother's voice trailed in from the kitchen.

"Alty, what'll you be wanting for breakfast?"

Skimming through a catalogue of choices in his mind, Alty Jayden resonated back eagerly. He wanted something dry, something luscious, something toasty, to begin his typical promising day with.

"I'll be happy with some cheese sandwiches, please."

As he continued to walk along a corridor carpeted neatly, a dazzling burst of sunlight distracted his attention, from an ornate glass pane. He peered outside and fed his vision with an outstanding view of stratocumuli clouds about to intercept the sun's power. They moved slowly with a tranquil silence above.

Nevertheless, little did Altair know what fate had in store for him. High school wasn't an option.
